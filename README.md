 LLM Financial System - Architectural Blueprint and Tech Stack Finalization
Architectural Overview
The XNL LLM Financial System will be designed to provide an AI-powered financial chatbot that assists users with their financial inquiries and transaction management. The architecture will be modular, allowing for scalability and easy integration of new features.

Key Components
Frontend
Framework: Streamlit
Functionality: User interface for the chatbot, allowing users to interact with the system, ask questions, and view transaction data.

Backend
Framework: FastAPI
Functionality: Handles API requests, processes user queries, and integrates with the GPT-4 model for natural language understanding.

Database
Type: PostgreSQL
Functionality: Stores user data, transaction records, and any other relevant information. PostgreSQL is chosen for its robustness and support for complex queries.
Vector Database
Type: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
Functionality: Enables efficient vector retrieval for context-aware responses from the chatbot.

Cloud Infrastructure
Provider: Heroku for PostgreSQL
Functionality: Hosts the application and database, providing a scalable environment for development and testing.
Security Measures
Authentication: Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication.
Data Encryption: Ensure data is encrypted both at rest and in transit to protect sensitive information.
Access Control: Implement role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive data.
Compliance and Regulatory Frameworks
Ensure adherence to relevant regulations such as GDPR for data protection and privacy.
Implement logging and auditing mechanisms to track data access and modifications.

Technology Stack
Frontend: Streamlit
Backend: FastAPI
Machine Learning Model: GPT-4 (via Hugging Face Transformers)
Database: PostgreSQL (hosted on a free-tier cloud provider)
Vector Database: FAISS
